Symbolic manuscript decryption challenge – €500 prize &amp; co-authorship

Call for Scientific Contributions –
A Symbolic System Awaiting Decryption
Introduction
This project centers on the analysis of a manuscript composed of hand-drawn symbolic line structures, created by Philippe Lathan through a process resembling automatic writing. The manuscript contains 26 pages filled with structured line arrangements that appear to follow hidden rules or symbolic grammar. Its origin and meaning are unknown.
Objective
We aim to uncover the structure, meaning, or potential encoding logic behind these symbolic pages. We invite interdisciplinary collaboration from researchers in mathematics, computer science, music theory, architecture, linguistics, and other relevant fields.
Call for Contributions
We are looking for:
- pattern recognition methods
- symbolic interpretation and rule extraction
- generative model proposals
- analogies to existing symbolic systems

What we offer:
- €500 reward for decisive contributions
- co-authorship in planned scientific publications
- official recognition on the project’s publication or web presence
Manuscript Excerpt
A 10-page excerpt from the manuscript is included below for analysis and exploration.
